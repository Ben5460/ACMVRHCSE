## Introduction
Requirements engineering plays an important role in the field of software engineering and determines the key factors for the ultimate success of software. Compared to requirements engineering, the focus of human-centric requirements engineering is the human factor. We recommend using virtual reality technology to promote the progress of human-centric requirements engineering. As a novel and interesting research field-VR is a human-centric requirements engineering platform. Our platform mainly has automatically create 3D avatars based on persona, simulate different, environmental factors (such as lighting and weather conditions) and user conditions (such as colour blindness), as well as the user's point of view through the first-person perspective.
