## Introduction
Requirements engineering plays an important role in the field of software engineering and determines the key factors for the ultimate success of software. Compared to requirements engineering, the focus of human-centric requirements engineering is the human factor. We recommend using virtual reality technology to promote the progress of human-centric requirements engineering. As a novel and interesting research field-VR is a human-centric requirement engineering platform. The platform mainly has automatically create 3D avatars based on persona, simulate different, environmental factors and user conditions, as well as the user's point of view through the first-person perspective.
## Functions
* Automated generation of 3D avatars based on user personas
* Simulation of different environments and user conditions
* Embodiment of userâ€™s perspective via first person view
