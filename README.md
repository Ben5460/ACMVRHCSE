# VR Platform
## Introduction
Requirements engineering plays an important role in the field of software engineering and determines the key factors for the ultimate success of software. Compared to requirements engineering, the focus of human-centric requirements engineering is the human factor. We    recommend using virtual reality technology to promote the progress of human-centric     requirements engineering. As a novel and interesting research field-VR is a human-centric requirement engineering platform. The platform mainly has automatically create 3D avatars based on persona, simulate different, environmental factors and user conditions, as well as the user's point of view through the first-person perspective.
## Functions
* **Automated generation of 3D avatars:** Features of a persona such as age, gender, height and weight. Can be automatically extracted from the textual data and used in the creation of the 3D avatars in platform.
* **Simulation of different environments and user conditions:** The platform is able to simulate various environments under different settings such as indoor, outdoor, and special weather conditions.Meanwhile, for users with special conditions, for example, colourblindness, the platform is able to simulate the environment in way that is consistent with the view and feelings of users with special conditions.
* **Embodiment of userâ€™s perspective via first person view:**  The  VR  platform  can provide first person  view so  that  software  engineers  can  see  exactly  what  the  users  see.
## Tools and Dependencies
